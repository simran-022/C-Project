# C++ Project

C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages. C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems. C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.

PROBLEM STATEMENT -
a. Program a two-person game of Tic -Tac- Toe. The game is played on a three-by-three board. Each player has a marker. One player has an ‘X’, the other an ‘O’. Players alternate turns to place their marker on the board. The first player to get three in a row either diagonally, horizontally, or vertically, wins the games. In the event all squares are taken on the board without a winner then it is a tie. If the information provided by the user at any stage of the program is invalid, the program should prompt until valid information is provided. After the game has been completed, the program should congratulate the winner by name ‘X’ or ‘O’.
b. Thisis a Number Guessing Game. Player deposits an initial amount to start playing the game. He guesses a number between 1 to 9 and enters a betting amount. If he wins, he will get 10 times of money he bets. If he bets on wrong number, he will lose his betting amount. Game continues till user wants to play.
